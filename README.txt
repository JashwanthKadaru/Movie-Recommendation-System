SVD and K-Means:
1. Import the .ipynb file on kaggle or google colab. 
2. Replace the path to the movies.dat file in the first cell, and the ratings.dat file in the third cell
3. Click run all, the 3rd last cell takes in user input for rating prediction
4. The last two cells are used for error calculation by tuning the hyperparameters and running the PCA function

Collaborative Filtering:
1. Upload the .ipynb file on kaggle or google colab.
2. Replace the path to all the files in the third cell
3. The choices are entered in the third cell as a dictionary with the key being the line number of the movie, and the value is the rating.
